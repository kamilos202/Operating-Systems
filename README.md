# Operating-Systems

## Learning outcome
Working on NachOS and implementing particular components I have learnt how operating system works.

## Coursework
* implemeting virtual memory functions
* implementing LRU (Last Recently Used) algorithm needed for page replacement

More about implementation parts can be found in the report (Experiment3_Report.pdf).

## Knowledge acquired

1. Knowledge about simple OS - NachOS
2. Overview of operating system concepts (Processes and Threads, Process Scheduling and Synchronization, Deadlocks)
3. Virtual Memory and I/O devices management.
